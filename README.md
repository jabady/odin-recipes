# odin-recipes
I will be using my current knowledge on HTML to create a recipe website.
First I will make a github repository and then clone it onto my PC.
From there I will be able to add and commit changes to any files in there before finally pushing my changes into the remote repository that is github.
I think this is a pretty cool experience learning to work with the terminal to push changes through to a remote repository.
The website should consist of a main index page (which I think I'll create along with a folder containing new recipe pages called pages) along with 3 recipes. 
Along the way I will use git add and git commit to keep track of changes along the way. 
This is just to show off how much HTML I have learned and later on we'll revisit this project to spice it up with CSS and maybe javascript. (THIS SHOULD GET SHOWN THROUGH COMMIT CHANGES ON GITHUB)
