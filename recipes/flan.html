        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A custard dessert with a layer of caramel. A recipe my family loves to make.</p>
        <p>It is not a difficult recipe to make, the only complicated part is making the caramel and the most complicated tool to have is a blender.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
            <li>14 ounce can of sweetend condensed milk</li>
            <li>8 ounces of softened cream cheese</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>12 ounce can of evaporated milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
            <li>Use a blender to combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, cream cheese, eggs, and vanilla extract.</li>

            <li>Set a roasting pan filled half way with water in over.</li>
            <li>Heat sugar and water at a medium heat in a small saucepan.</li>
            <li>It will take about 8 to 10 minutes to create caramel from sugar and water.</li>
            <li><strong>NEVER STOP STIRRING</strong></li>
            <li>Pour melted sugar caramel (<em>heated sugar water mixture</em> into a 9x13 inch baking dish coating the bottom and sides of the dish.</li>
            <li>Pour in the blended dairy mixture into the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place the entire baking dish into the roasting pan filled halfway with water.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>Test for doneness by sticking a knife into the center of the flan. If it comes out clean, you are ready to take it out.</li>
